# WhatsappClone

Went over this tutorial: [Reverse Engineering WhatsApp Web’s CSS](https://blog.animaapp.com/reverse-engineering-whatsapp-webs-css-9239293009f4) and figured it would be a good
learning experience to reproduce whatsapp's interface in an angular application.

Also applied the [7–1 Sass/SCSS Pattern](https://medium.com/@aaronverones/using-the-7-1-sass-scss-pattern-with-angular-7-bb210c015dcc), and made use of mixins.

The only regret is that I haven't managed to optimize the chat background image.
